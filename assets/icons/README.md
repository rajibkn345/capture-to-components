# Extension Icons

This directory contains the icon files for the Chrome extension.

## Required Icons

- `icon16.png` - 16x16px icon for the extension
- `icon32.png` - 32x32px icon for the extension
- `icon48.png` - 48x48px icon for the extension
- `icon128.png` - 128x128px icon for the extension

## Icon Guidelines

- Use PNG format for best quality
- Ensure icons are clear and recognizable at all sizes
- Follow Chrome extension icon guidelines
- Use consistent design across all sizes

## Placeholder Icons

Currently using placeholder icon references. Replace with actual icon files:

1. Create or design icons representing route capture/component generation
2. Export in required sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128)
3. Save as PNG files in this directory
4. Update manifest.json if filename changes are needed

## Design Suggestions

- Use symbols related to:
  - Routes/paths (arrows, lines)
  - Components (building blocks, puzzle pieces)
  - Capture/screenshot (camera, frame)
  - Code generation (brackets, code symbols)
